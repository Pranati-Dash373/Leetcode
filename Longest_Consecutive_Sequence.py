Docstring for Longest_Consecutive_Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

        numset = set(nums)
        longest = 0
        for i in numset:
            if (i-1) not in numset:
                length = 0
                while (i+length) in numset:
                    length = length + 1
                longest = max(length , longest)
        return longest
